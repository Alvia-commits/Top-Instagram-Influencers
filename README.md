Project: Top Instagram Influencer Analysis
1. Introduction

The project aims to analyze top Instagram influencers to understand how follower count, engagement rate, and influence score vary across countries and accounts. The goal was to uncover what makes an influencer impactful — whether it's follower size, engagement consistency, or regional trends.
By studying metrics like influence score, engagement rate, and average likes, we identified the most influential personalities and countries dominating the social media landscape.

2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to focus on main influencer metrics.
- Handled missing values — particularly in country and followers columns — by filling with “Unknown” or median values.
- Standardized follower numbers (e.g., converting “342.7M” to numerical format).
- Ensured proper data types for numerical calculations and visualizations.
- Cleaned country names (fixed encoding issues like “CÃ´te d'Ivoire” → “Côte d'Ivoire”).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key visualizations and findings:

1. Top Influencer: Selena Gomez (United States) — Influence Score: 93, Followers: 342.7M

2. Most Engaging Influencer: j.m — Engagement Rate: 26.41%

3. Country with Most Influencers: United States (66 influencers), followed by Brazil and India.

4. Engagement Rate vs Follower Range:
Influencers with <100M followers show higher engagement (~2%) compared to mega accounts.

5. Average Influence Score by Country:
Highest in Australia, Canada, Italy, and Switzerland (scores above 85).

6. Likes Comparison (Pie Chart):
Average Likes: 59.7%, New Post Likes: 40.3% — indicating stable audience engagement.

7. Country-wise Engagement Rate:
Top countries by engagement: Uruguay (5.4%), Mexico (4.36%), Côte d'Ivoire (3.82%).

Developed nations like the US and UK show lower engagement despite high follower counts.

4. Recommendations

- Brands should focus on micro and mid-tier influencers (<100M followers) for better engagement.
- Emerging markets (Uruguay, Mexico, Côte d'Ivoire) show stronger engagement potential — great for regional campaigns.
- Influencers should focus on interaction quality rather than follower growth alone.
- Regular posting doesn’t always mean higher influence — maintaining audience authenticity is key.

5. Limitations

- Dataset may not include all top influencers, leading to partial country representation.
- Some country data missing (“Unknown” category).
- Influence score calculation method may vary — not standardized across platforms.
- Time-based trends (e.g., post timing or content type) were not analyzed.

6. Conclusion

The analysis shows that engagement and authenticity matter more than follower size in determining influence.
While the United States leads in number of influencers, countries with smaller markets often show higher audience interaction.
Overall, this project highlights the importance of balanced follower growth, content engagement, and country-specific strategy in influencer marketing success.
